This site has been built with an eponymous pseudo-platform I call "jim" for fun:

* **Jade** - The [Jade template engine](http://jade-lang.com/) for node.js (and io.js).
* **io.js** - The npm-compatible [fork](https://iojs.org/en/index.html) of node.js.
* **Markdown** - The [lightweight markup language](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

It was done as both an exercise in tongue-in-cheekiness and to learn more about
the io.js environment, especially more than just your usual [MEAN](http://mean.io/#!/)
stack web dev.

You can [fork the jim stack from GitHub](https://github.com/dullroar/jim).
